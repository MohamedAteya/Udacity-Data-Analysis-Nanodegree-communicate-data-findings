# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Mohamed Ateya


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides madein a bike-sharing system covering the greater San FranciscoBay area.


## Summary of Findings

> the features of interest are the duration of the trip and its relation with other features, the number of taken trips in terms of time, week day, and month, and how the type of the user affects all of that.<br>
The duration and the number of trips are the variables of interest.<br>

>duration distribution: 
The duration is right-skewed. 
75% of durations are less than or equal to 15 minutes. 
The mean duration = 11.64 minute. 
The number of trips: 
The frequency of trips in terms of the time of the day, the day of the week, and the month are all skewed and show that people take trips in some times more than others.

>The trip mean duration in minutes that the Customer user_type use greater than the Subscriber user_type.

> the subscribers are more than the Customers regardless of the weekday, but the weekend is the highest day for both. we can notice also that the number of customers on the first day of the week is close to the number of customers on the weekend when the subscribersâ€™ number decreased by order of magnitude!

> -In terms of trip duration:
The trip mean duration time in minutes that the Customer user type use is greater than the Subscriber user type.
As expected, the greater the distance between the start and the end stations, the greater the mean trip duration time.
-In tirms of Number of trips:
the subscribers are more than the Customers regardless of the weekday, but the weekend is the highest day for both. we can notice also that the number of customer

>In most of the days the trip duration time of the subscribers is short compared to the customers'.
Except on the first day of the week, more subscribers take more time. and more Customers take shorter time.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I presented 10 graphs from my exploration, with some comments and snips of code -you can show the code snip by clicking the graph-. Hope that the presentation helps to answer most of the questions.
